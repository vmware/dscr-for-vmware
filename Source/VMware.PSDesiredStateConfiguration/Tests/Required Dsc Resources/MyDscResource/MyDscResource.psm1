{
    <#
       This property is the fully qualified path to the file that is
       expected to be present or absent.

       The [DscProperty(Key)] attribute indicates the property is a
       key and its value uniquely identifies a resource instance.
       Defining this attribute also means the property is required
       and DSC will ensure a value is set before calling the resource.

       A DSC resource must define at least one key property.
    #>
    [DscProperty(Key)]
    [string]$Path

    <#
        This property indicates if the settings should be present or absent
        on the system. For present, the resource ensures the file pointed
        to by $Path exists. For absent, it ensures the file point to by
        $Path does not exist.

        The [DscProperty(Mandatory)] attribute indicates the property is
        required and DSC will guarantee it is set.

        If Mandatory is not specified or if it is defined as
        Mandatory=$false, the value is not guaranteed to be set when DSC
        calls the resource.  This is appropriate for optional properties.
    #>

    <#
       This property defines the fully qualified path to a file that will
       be placed on the system if $Ensure = Present and $Path does not
        exist.

       NOTE: This property is required because [DscProperty(Mandatory)] is
        set.

       [DscProperty(NotConfigurable)] attribute indicates the property is
       not configurable in DSC configuration.  Properties marked this way
       are populated by the Get() method to report additional details
       about the resource when it is present.
