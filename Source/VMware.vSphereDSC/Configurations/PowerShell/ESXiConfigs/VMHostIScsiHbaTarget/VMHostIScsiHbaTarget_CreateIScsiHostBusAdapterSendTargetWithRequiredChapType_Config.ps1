.DESCRIPTION

Creates a new iSCSI Host Bus Adapter Send target with address '10.23.84.73' on port '3260' for the specified iSCSI Host Bus Adapter. Also it configures the CHAP settings of the
iSCSI Host Bus Adapter target by specifiying the CHAP type as 'Required' with CHAP name 'AdminOne' and CHAP password 'AdminPasswordOne'.
The Mutual CHAP is enabled with Mutual CHAP name 'AdminTwo' and Mutual CHAP password 'AdminPasswordTwo'. CHAP and Mutual CHAP settings are not inherited from the iSCSI Host Bus Adapter.
