.DESCRIPTION

The Configuration does the following:
1. Creates/Updates Port Group 'MyStandardPortGroup' which belongs to Standard Switch 'MyStandardSwitch' with VLanId set to '1'.
2. Enables the Shaping Policy and sets the 'BurstSize', 'Average' and 'Peak bandwidth' values.
3. Enables 'Promiscuous mode', 'Forged Transmits' and 'Mac Changes'. The Security Policy settings are not inherited from the parent Standard Switch 'MyStandardSwitch'.
4. Sets the active Nics to be 'vmnic2' and 'vmnnic3', the LoadBalancing Policy to 'LoadBalanceIP' and the NetworkFailover Policy to 'LinkStatus'.
   The Teaming Policy settings are not inherited from the parent Standard Switch 'MyStandardSwitch'.
