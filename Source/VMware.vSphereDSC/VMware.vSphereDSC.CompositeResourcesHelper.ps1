.SYNOPSIS
Creates a new Resource Block for the specified Resource with the specified properties.

.DESCRIPTION
Creates a new Resource Block for the specified Resource with the specified properties. The Resource
Block is part of a Configuration. The function allows to dynamically pass Resource properties to the
Resource Block based on some criteria, which is not possible if the Resource Block is directly defined
in the Configuration.
Example function output:
Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [hashtable]
    $Parameters
)

VMHostVssPortGroup VMHostVssPortGroup {
    VssName = $Parameters['VssName']
    VMHostName = $Parameters['VMHostName']
    Server = $Parameters['Server']
    Credential = $Parameters['Credential']
    Name = $Parameters['Name']
    Ensure = $Parameters['Ensure']
}

.PARAMETER ResourceName
Specifies the name of the Resource.

.PARAMETER Properties
Specifies the properties that are going to be populated for the specified Resource.

    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param(

        $ResourceName,

        The scriptBlock gets returned so that it can be invoked in the caller's scope.
        The earlier implementation of the scriptBlock getting invoked in this function
        was causing problems with custom defined functions for the DSC Resources,
        because they and other script variables can't be seen in this scope.

.SYNOPSIS
Pushes the specified properties that are not $null to the properties hashtable.

.DESCRIPTION
Pushes the specified properties that are not $null to the properties hashtable. $null properties are not pushed
to the properties hashtable, because when the Configuration is parsed, the compiled MOF contains all $null properties
with their default values depending on the type, instead of ignoring them and them not being part of the compiled MOF file.

.PARAMETER ResourceBlockProperties
Specifies the hashtable with the properties that are going to be passed to the Resource Block.

.PARAMETER NullableProperties
Specifies the nullable properties that are going to be pushed to the properties hashtable. Only properties with value that is
different from $null are going to be pushed to the properties hashtable.
