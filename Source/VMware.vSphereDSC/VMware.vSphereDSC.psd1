    The RequiredModules were added to enable installing the module with all needed dependencies.
    We are facing problems with Invoke-DSCResource cmdlet on PowerShell 7.0 related to PowerCLI inability to work in multiple PowerShell runspaces. 
    Removing RequiredModules is a workaround of this PowerCLI bug that allows vSphere.DSC Resources to be invoked with PS7.0 Invoke-DSCResource.
    The disadvantage though is PowerCLI has to be installed separately as a prerequisite.
