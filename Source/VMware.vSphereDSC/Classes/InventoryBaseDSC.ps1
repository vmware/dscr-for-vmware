class InventoryBaseDSC : BaseDSC {
    <#
    .DESCRIPTION

    Name of the Inventory Item (Folder or Datacenter) located in the Folder specified in 'Location' key property.
    #>
    [DscProperty(Key)]
    [string] $Name

    <#
    .DESCRIPTION

    Location of the Inventory Item (Folder or Datacenter) we will use from the Inventory.
    Root Folder of the Inventory is not part of the Location.
    Empty Location means that the Inventory Item (Folder or Datacenter) is in the Root Folder of the Inventory.
    Folder names in Location are separated by "/".
    Example Location: "MyDatacenters".
    #>
    [DscProperty(Key)]
    [string] $Location

    <#
    .DESCRIPTION

    Value indicating if the Inventory Item (Folder or Datacenter) should be Present or Absent.
    #>
    [DscProperty(Mandatory)]
    [Ensure] $Ensure

    <#
    .DESCRIPTION

    Ensures the correct behaviour when the Location is not valid based on the passed Ensure value.
    If Ensure is set to 'Present' and the Location is not valid, the method should throw with the passed error message.
    Otherwise Ensure is set to 'Absent' and $null result is returned because with invalid Location, the Inventory Item is 'Absent'
    from that Location and no error should be thrown.
